# Governance Artifacts

This repository documents **audit-grade governance artifacts**.

It does not provide trading strategies, execution logic, models, parameters,
or performance claims of any kind.

The purpose of this repository is to preserve **irreversible behavioral constraints**
that are enforced *before* discretion, pressure, or hindsight can intervene.

---

## What This Repository Is

This repository contains:

- Governance decision schemas
- Audit event schemas
- Redacted examples of decisions that were explicitly **not allowed**
- Governance principles that apply equally to operators and creators

These artifacts are not hypothetical.
They represent constraints that have already been enforced in practice
and recorded for auditability.

---

## What This Repository Enforces

The governance system documented here enforces the following:

- Certain actions are prohibited regardless of confidence or opportunity
- Human override is treated as a **failure mode**, not a feature
- Decisions are evaluated by **scope and traceability**, not outcomes
- Governance constraints apply to the system creator without exception

The system does not optimize for performance.
It exists to restrict behavior precisely when judgment is most likely to fail.

---

## What This Repository Explicitly Does NOT Do

This repository does not:

- Offer deployable software or services
- Provide configuration, thresholds, or tuning guidance
- Allow discretionary override or emergency exception
- Support retrospective justification based on outcomes
- Serve as a product, SDK, or strategy template

Questions of “why not allow exceptions” are out of scope.
Exceptions are treated as governance failure.

## How This Work Should Be Evaluated

This work is not evaluated through persuasion, benchmarking, or demonstration.

It is evaluated through:

- Clarity of enforced scope
- Coverage of known failure modes
- Irreversibility of constraints
- Audit traceability under stress
- Consistency across time

If these criteria are insufficient, this work is not a fit.

## Status

This repository is intentionally incomplete.

It represents a living record of governance constraints that have already
been enforced and preserved here as artifacts.

No roadmap is provided.
No expansion is promised.
