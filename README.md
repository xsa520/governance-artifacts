# Governance Artifacts

⚠️ **This is not an engineering repository.**

This repository is a curated archive of **audit-grade governance artifacts**.

It contains **records of enforced behavioral constraints**, preserved as
immutable references for audit, review, and accountability purposes.

There is **no executable code**, **no system design**, and **no implementation guidance** here.

---

## What This Repository Is

This repository exists to preserve **governance facts**, not to enable systems.

It contains:

- Formal boundary definitions (`BOUNDARIES.md`)
- Statements of irreversibility (`IRREVERSIBILITY.md`)
- Redacted records of disallowed decisions (`samples/`)
- Governance event schemas for audit traceability (`schema/`)
- Explicit non-goals and intentional incompleteness (`STATUS.md`)

These artifacts document **what was not allowed**, **what could not be overridden**,
and **what was enforced before discretion or hindsight**.

---

## What This Repository Is Not

This repository does **not** provide:

- Software systems
- Execution logic
- Runtime enforcement mechanisms
- Reference implementations
- Configuration options
- Operational guidance
- Exception handling pathways

Any attempt to treat these artifacts as an implementation blueprint
is a category error.

---

## How This Work Should Be Read

These materials are meant to be **examined**, not used.

They should be read as:

- Governance evidence
- Audit records
- Constraint declarations
- Decision boundary documentation

They are **not adaptable**, **not parameterized**, and **not extendable**.

---

## Responsibility Boundary

This repository does not participate in enforcement.

Any system claiming to “implement” these artifacts does so
**without endorsement** and **without validation** from this work.

For explicit scope limits, see [`BOUNDARIES.md`](BOUNDARIES.md).  
For irreversibility guarantees, see [`IRREVERSIBILITY.md`](IRREVERSIBILITY.md).  
For intentional incompleteness, see [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md).  
For misuse prevention, see [`ANTI_MISUSE.md`](ANTI_MISUSE.md).

---

## Status

This repository is intentionally incomplete.

No roadmap is provided.  
No expansion is promised.

It represents a preserved record of governance constraints
that have already been enforced elsewhere.
