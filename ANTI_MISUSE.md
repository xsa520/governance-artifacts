# Anti-Misuse Notice

This repository is not a framework, reference implementation, or design guide.

It explicitly does **not** support:

- Implementation guidance
- Enforcement mechanisms
- Operational workflows
- System architecture advice
- Exception handling strategies
- Adaptation into runtime systems

## Prohibited Interpretations

The following interpretations are invalid:

- “How would you implement this?”
- “How can this be adapted to my system?”
- “What happens in edge cases?”
- “Can this be extended to support X?”

Such questions fall outside the scope of this repository.

## Responsibility Boundary

Any system claiming to implement or derive behavior from these artifacts
does so **without endorsement** and **without validation** from this work.

This repository preserves governance facts only.
It does not participate in their execution.
