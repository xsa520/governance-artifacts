# Irreversibility Statement

This repository contains governance artifacts that represent **finalized decisions**.

Once recorded, these artifacts are:

- Not subject to revision
- Not correctable through additional context
- Not overridable by authority, urgency, or hindsight
- Not superseded by later policy changes

## What Irreversibility Means Here

Irreversibility does **not** mean immutability of files.

It means:

- The *decision state* represented by an artifact is final
- Subsequent knowledge does not alter its validity
- No corrective narrative is permitted after the fact

Artifacts may be added.
Artifacts may be contextualized elsewhere.
Artifacts are **never invalidated**.

## Explicit Exclusions

This repository does not provide:

- Rollback mechanisms
- Exception review processes
- Appeal paths
- Emergency override doctrines
- Post-hoc justification frameworks

Any attempt to reinterpret an artifact as
"understandable given circumstances"
or
"acceptable due to urgency"
constitutes a governance failure.

## Audit Position

For audit purposes:

- Presence of an artifact implies enforcement occurred
- Absence of an artifact implies no enforcement record exists
- Silence is not ambiguity

This repository is treated as an **append-only record of enforced boundaries**.

No corrective layer exists above it.
