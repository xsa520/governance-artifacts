# Samples — Redacted Governance Decisions

The files in this directory are **redacted records of governance decisions**.

They are provided solely to demonstrate:
- The structure of audit-grade decision records
- The irreversibility of enforced constraints
- The absence of discretionary exceptions

These samples:
- Are not recommendations
- Are not configurable examples
- Do not imply optional behavior

Each record represents a decision that was **already finalized**
and preserved only for audit traceability.
