# Reading Order — Governance Artifacts

This document defines the **required reading order** for this repository.

This order is **normative**, not advisory.

Reading files out of order will result in misunderstanding of scope, intent, and guarantees.
Such misunderstandings are the responsibility of the reader.

---

## Required Order

Readers **must** proceed in the following sequence:

1. **README.md**  
   Establishes what this repository is *and is not*.

2. **BOUNDARIES.md**  
   Defines explicit scope limits, non-goals, and exclusions.

3. **IRREVERSIBILITY.md**  
   Explains the finality of recorded decisions and constraints.

4. **STATUS.md**  
   Declares intentional incompleteness and absence of roadmap.

5. **ANTI_MISUSE.md**  
   Clarifies non-implementable scope and prohibits misuse.

6. **/schema/**  
   Provides formal definitions of governance and audit records.

7. **/samples/**  
   Contains redacted examples demonstrating enforced constraints.

## Prohibited Reading Patterns

The following are **explicitly discouraged**:

- Treating this repository as an implementation guide
- Skipping boundary or irreversibility definitions
- Reading schemas or samples in isolation
- Inferring executable behavior, logic, or systems

---

## Interpretation Responsibility

This repository does not adapt to the reader.

If a reader interprets these artifacts as:
- Recommendations
- Configurable templates
- Strategy guidance
- Engineering documentation

That interpretation is **invalid**.

---

## Final Note

These artifacts are not designed to persuade.

They exist to **record**, **constrain**, and **preserve** decisions
that are no longer subject to discretion.
